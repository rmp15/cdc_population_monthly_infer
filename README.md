# Generate monthly population by sex, 5- and 10-year age group, race, ethnicity, county in the United States 1982-2020

Work in progress by Robbie M Parks

Currently monthly population (vintage 2020) during 1982 - 2020 for females and males by five-year (0-4, 5-9,.....,85+ years) and ten-year age group (0-4,5-14,15-24,...,65-74,75-84,85+ years) for all counties (by FIPS code) in US except Alaska (working on it).

## Data for use by year and sex

[5-year age groups](output/population_processed/5_year_age_groups)

[10-year age groups](output/population_processed/10_year_age_groups)

[Race groups](output/population_processed/race_groups)

[Ethnicity groups](output/population_processed/ethnicity_groups)

## Important details

a_03 contains a look-up of FIPS Codes which have been changed over time to be consistent over time.

## Instructions on downloading raw origin files
